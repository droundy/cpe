1. Find Q from V (integrating in?)

   Self-consistent anion and cation densities, with electrostatic
   potential and chemical potential (i.e. the repulsion we're talking
   about).

1. [DONE] Either experiment with tweaking V to get a better Z(omega),
   or go for the full inverse computation, computing V given Z(omega).
