Here are some nice plots.  We should really describe them and write
some text.

\section{Concentration}

The concentration as a function of DC voltage using Poisson-Boltzmann
equation.  I will use Gaussian units, which means that Poisson's
equation is given by:
\begin{align}
  \nabla^2 \psi = \frac{4\pi}{\epsilon} \rho
\end{align}
For simplicity we assume that we have single-charged cations and
anions.
\begin{align}
  \rho = e (n_{+} - n_{-})
\end{align}
We can find the number densities of ions from
\begin{align}
  n_{\pm} = n_0 \exp(\mp\beta e \psi)
\end{align}
keeping in mind that $\psi\rightarrow 0$ far from the surface.

Actually, we can solve for $\psi(x)$ analytically, and from that
obtain the densities.

\section{Conductivity}

The conductivity is a function of ion concentration.  At sufficiently
low densities, the conductivity due to each species is proportional to
its density.  At higher densities, we should use Kohlrausch's law,
which accounts for repulsive interactions between ions of the same
charge.  Sadly, Kohlrausch's law fails at very high concentrations,
which is a problem because the concentration tends to get very high
near the charged surface.
