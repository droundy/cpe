Here are some nice plots.  We should really describe them and write
some text.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{potential-energy-vs-distance}
  \caption{This is the potential energy computed using an assumption
    of simple electrostatics with a continuum dielectric.  We expect
    this to break down at short distances from the graphene, distances
    comparable to the important solvation shells.}

  \caption{This is the concentration of ions versus distance from the
    graphene, based on the potential in Fig.~\ref{fig:pot}.}

\section{Finding the capacitance from the potential energy}

How does concentration come from potential energy?

\begin{align}
  n_i(x) = n_{i0} \exp\left(-\beta \left(V_{\text{graphene}}(x)
                                       + q_i \Phi(x)\right)\right)
\end{align}
where $\Phi$ is the electrostatic potential.  Then we can compute the
charge density $\rho(x)$ from
\begin{align}
  \rho(x) = \sum_i q_i n_i(x)
\end{align}
and finally, the Poisson equation...
\begin{align}
  \nabla^2 \Phi(x) = -\frac{\rho(x)}{\epsilon_0\epsilon_w}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \nabla^2 \Phi(x) = -\frac{\sum_i q_i n_i(x)}{\epsilon_0\epsilon_w}
\end{align}
Gauss' Law!

\section{Finding potential energy from impedance}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{optimal-Z-fit}
  \caption{The frequency-dependent impedance, experiment
    vs. theoretical fit.}\label{fig:optimal-Z-fit}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{optimal-resistivity}
  \caption{The resistivity curve that best fits the impedance of one
    particular experiment.}\label{fig:optimal-resistivity}
\end{figure}

I have written some code (see \texttt{transposed\_resistivity.py}) that
finds the resistivity curve that best fits the experimental
impedence.  See Fig.~\ref{fig:optimal-Z-fit} for a plot of the fit.
One thing I discovered was that I seem to have the real and imaginary
parts swapped in either experiment or theory.  Or at least, I'm unable
to reproduce experiment without swapping the two.  This should be
looked into.

Figure~\ref{fig:optimal-resistivity} shows the optimal resistivity
curve.  The fit works by adjusting the $\Delta x$ values and thus
$x(\rho)$, rather than $\rho(x)$.  This turns the function from a
nonlinear integration into a linear summation of the varying
quantities, which seems simpler.  As you can see in
Fig.~\ref{fig:optimal-resistivity}, the lengths scale seems way off,
and I don't understand why this is.

\fixme{

  I need still to do the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Solve for concentration based on resistivity.
  \item Solve for potential energy based on concentrations.
  \end{enumerate}
  Neither of these steps should be hard, but I see no reason to do
  them until after fixing the bugs I have already found.

\section{Concentration}

The concentration as a function of DC voltage using Poisson-Boltzmann
equation.  I will use Gaussian units, which means that Poisson's
equation is given by:
\begin{align}
  \nabla^2 \psi = \frac{4\pi}{\epsilon} \rho
\end{align}
For simplicity we assume that we have single-charged cations and
anions.
\begin{align}
  \rho = e (n_{+} - n_{-})
\end{align}
We can find the number densities of ions from
\begin{align}
  n_{\pm} = n_0 \exp(\mp\beta e \psi)
\end{align}
keeping in mind that $\psi\rightarrow 0$ far from the surface.

Actually, we can solve for $\psi(x)$ analytically, and from that
obtain the densities.

\section{Conductivity}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{resistivity}
  \caption{Resistivity as a function of distance from the capacitor
    surface.}
\end{figure}

The conductivity is a function of ion concentration.  At sufficiently
low densities, the conductivity due to each species is proportional to
its density.  At higher densities, we should use Kohlrausch's law,
which accounts for repulsive interactions between ions of the same
charge.  Sadly, Kohlrausch's law fails at very high concentrations,
which is a problem because the concentration tends to get very high
near the charged surface.
